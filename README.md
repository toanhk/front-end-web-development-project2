# Landing Page Project
This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality you will be using serves two purposes: to prepare you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site. This project barely touches the surface of what is possible, but it does use some incredibly common events, methods, and logic.

For this project, refactor and test as much as possible while you are building. You should figure for every piece of functionality you add, you will likely spend just as much time testing and refactoring your code. If it takes you 3 hours to figure out the logic, it should likely take you another 3 hours determining that you wrote the best code possible. As your skills improve, this process will feel more natural. Make sure to remove any debugging code from your final submission.

# Quickstart/Demo

I believe that you should bring value to the reader as soon as possible. You should be able to get the user up and running with your project with minimal friction.

If you have a quickstart guide, this is where it should be.

Alternatively, you can add a demo to show what your project can do.

# Installation
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

This is where your installation instructions go.
# Usage
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)
You can display it on mobile, tablet and desktop

# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

You have people who want to use your project and then you have people who want contribute to your project.

This is where you provide instructions for the latter.

Add instructions on how to set up a development environment, clone, and build the project.

You can use the code snippets here as well:

```shell
command to clone your project
command to build your project
command to run your project in development mode
